# XGBoost Model Project

This project involves the use of the XGBoost machine learning library to create a model for classification or regression tasks. This README provides an overview of the project structure, data preparation, model training, and how to use the trained model for predictions.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory for storing datasets (training and testing).
- `model/`: Directory for storing the trained model files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for model training, evaluation, and usage examples.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and model training.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Data Preparation

- The datasets for training and testing should be placed in the `data/` directory.
- Ensure the data is clean and properly formatted before model training.
- If necessary, use data processing scripts in `scripts/` to preprocess the data.

## Model Training

- The model can be trained using scripts in the `scripts/` directory.
- The training script will load data from `data/` and train the XGBoost model.
- Once trained, the model will be saved in the `model/` directory.

## Model Evaluation

- After training, evaluate the model on a test dataset to measure its performance.
- Use appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks, or mean squared error for regression tasks.

## Model Saving

- The trained XGBoost model is saved using the `joblib` library.
- The model file is saved in the `model/` directory.

## Model Loading

- The trained model can be loaded from the `model/` directory using the `joblib` library.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Prepare your data according to the [data preparation](#data-preparation) section.
3. Train the model using scripts in the `scripts/` directory.
4. Evaluate the model using the trained model file.
5. Use the model for predictions as needed.
